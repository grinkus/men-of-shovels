# Men of Shovels

## Final idea (before starting code)

*   The player is an undertaker struggling to dig a grave for every executed
    prisoner/friend/fellow-human-being. The executioner stands on a cliff
    and smacks the victim in the head with his shovel. While he's preparing
    for the execution, player sees an outline of the fall-path of the corpse.
    He has to dig the grave on that spot. If he succeeds, the grave covers
    itself up and a gravestone (cross) spawns on top of it. The undertaker
    has to collect crosses. If he fails to dig the hole on time, the corpse
    spatters on the ground (splat!), and an evil spirit rises, that attacks
    the undertaker to steal one of his crosses and flies off carrying it away
    to hell (or  heaven).

## Initial ideas

*   Multiplayer game where players have to achieve a goal within a period of
    time to reset the game-over count-down counter.

*   Game where the player has to determine which one of the NPCs is good in
    the world of baddies.

*   Multiplayer game where players have to [insert action]. Upon connecting to
    the server player receives a message along the lines of "Everyone in this
    world is bad. You are the only good one. Do [insert action] to save the
    world". Every player gets this message.
